      "2.  **Data Understanding:** Exploring and getting familiar with the data. This involves collecting, cleaning, and understanding the data's structure, quality, and meaning.\n",

      "    *   **Integration:** Combining data from multiple sources.\n",
      "    *   **Transformation:** Normalizing or aggregating data to make it suitable for mining.\n",
      "    *   **Reduction:** Reducing the size of the dataset while preserving important information.\n",
      "4.  **Modeling:** Selecting and applying appropriate data mining techniques (algorithms) to discover patterns. This is where the \"mining\" happens.\n",
      "5.  **Evaluation:** Assessing the quality and usefulness of the discovered patterns. Do they make sense? Are they statistically significant? Do they meet the business objectives?\n",

      "*   **Clustering:** Grouping similar data points together without predefined classes (e.g., segmenting customers into different groups based on their purchasing behavior).\n",
      "*   **Association Rule Mining:** Discovering relationships between items in a dataset (e.g., \"customers who buy bread also tend to buy milk\"). This is often used in market basket analysis.\n",
      "*   **Regression:** Predicting a continuous numerical value (e.g., predicting the price of a house based on its features).\n",
      "*   **Anomaly Detection (Outlier Detection):** Identifying data points that deviate significantly from the norm (e.g., detecting fraudulent transactions).\n",

      "\n",
      "**Director:** Quentin Tarantino\n",
      "\n",
      "**Why it's a perfect fit:** This film is essentially an Agatha Christie \"whodunnit\" mystery disguised as a Western. A group of dangerous and untrustworthy characters are trapped together in a remote cabin during a blizzard. The entire second half of the movie is a series of shocking reveals, betrayals, and twists that completely reframe everything you thought you knew.\n",
      "\n",
      "**The Plot (Spoiler-Free):** In post-Civil War Wyoming, bounty hunter John \"The Hangman\" Ruth (Kurt Russell) is escorting his fugitive prisoner, Daisy Domergue (Jennifer Jason Leigh), to the town of Red Rock to be hanged. Along the way, they pick up two strangers and are forced by a blizzard to take shelter at a stagecoach stopover called Minnie's Haberdashery, which is already occupied by a handful of other suspicious characters. As the storm rages outside, tensions and paranoia boil over inside, and it soon becomes clear that not everyone is who they claim to be.\n",
      "\n",
      "**What to Expect:**\n",
      "*   **Dialogue-heavy:** It's a Tarantino film, so expect sharp, witty, and often lengthy conversations.\n",
      "*   **Intense Suspense:** The single-location setting creates a palpable sense of claustrophobia and paranoia.\n",
      "*   **Brutal Violence:** When the violence happens, it is sudden, graphic, and impactful.\n",

      "\n",
      "If you've already seen *The Hateful Eight* or want other options, here are some fantastic Westerns where the twist is a key element.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 1. The Power of the Dog (2021)\n",
      "**The Twist:** A slow-burn, psychological twist that reveals itself in the final moments, recontextualizing the entire film and the motivations of its characters. It's less of a \"gotcha!\" and more of a chilling, dawning realization.\n",
      "**Synopsis:** A domineering and cruel rancher, Phil Burbank (Benedict Cumberbatch), torments his brother's new wife and her sensitive son, until he unexpectedly takes the boy under his wing. The film is a masterclass in tension, exploring themes of masculinity, repression, and revenge.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 2. Once Upon a Time in the West (1968)\n",
      "**The Twist:** A classic, character-defining reveal. For most of the film, the motive of the mysterious, harmonica-playing protagonist (Charles Bronson) is unknown. The twist, revealed in a powerful flashback during the final duel, explains his relentless quest for vengeance and is one of the most iconic moments in cinema history.\n",
      "**Synopsis:** This epic masterpiece from Sergio Leone follows three men converging on a piece of land in the path of the new railroad: a ruthless hired gun, a notorious outlaw, and a silent stranger with a harmonica.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 3. High Plains Drifter (1973)\n",
      "**The Twist:** A supernatural and ambiguous twist concerning the protagonist's identity. Clint Eastwood's \"The Stranger\" rides into a corrupt town and is hired to protect it from outlaws. His methods are brutal, and his nature is mysterious. The film heavily implies he is not just a man, but something more—perhaps the vengeful ghost of a marshal the townspeople let die.\n",
      "**Synopsis:** A mysterious stranger is hired by the cowardly citizens of a small mining town to defend them from three outlaws, but his price is to be given anything—and anyone—he wants.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### 4. Bone Tomahawk (2015)\n",
      "**The Twist:** This is a **genre-bending twist**. The film starts as a classic, character-driven rescue Western. A small posse sets out to rescue captives from a remote cave. However, about halfway through, the film takes a hard, shocking turn into brutal, unflinching survival horror. The twist isn't a plot point, but the horrifying reveal of what the posse is truly up against. **Warning: This film is extremely violent and graphic.**\n",
      "**Synopsis:** After a group of cannibalistic cave-dwellers abduct several settlers, an aging sheriff (Kurt Russell) leads a small group of men on a mission to bring them home.\n",

      "\t Quantum computing utilizes principles of quantum mechanics, such as superposition and entanglement, to perform computations.\n",
      "\t Unlike classical computers that use bits representing either 0 or 1, quantum computers use qubits.\n",
      "\t Qubits can represent 0, 1, or a superposition of both simultaneously.\n",
      "\t Entanglement allows qubits to be correlated in a way that their states are dependent on each other, regardless of the distance separating them.\n",

      "\n",
      "Implied Insights:\n",
      "\t Quantum computers are not intended to replace classical computers for everyday tasks like word processing or browsing the internet.\n",
      "\t The power of quantum computing lies in its ability to solve specific, complex problems that are intractable for even the most powerful supercomputers today.\n",

       " 'text': '**Page 1**\\n\"\"\"\\nDan Baldwin\\nGroup 4\\nAuteur Review - Interstellar \\nI believe Christopher Nolan: the director behind the 2014 sci-ﬁ/adventure cinematic ‘Interstellar,’ \\nto be a very intellectual and imaginative inventive talent.  \\nHis style in his previous ﬁlms sets characters in epic unique locations, with gargantuan issues to \\nface, and artistically impresses the audience with how the characters solve their problems. For \\nexample, in Nolan’s 2010 ﬁlm ‘Inception,’ he tackles the idea of dreams, and sets his characters \\ndiving through dreams within dreams within even more dreams to complete their goals. Because \\nthis idea is so farfetched, and dreams are a subject in which science has made little factual \\ndiscovery in, Nolan is free to use his creativity to present ideas such as landscapes folding in on \\nthemselves and corridors spinning, without seeming unrealistic. \\nThis brain-racking epic theme is once again evident in ‘Interstellar,’ as Nolan sets his characters \\nduring a second American dust bowl on future Earth. The world is short of food, and will soon be \\nuninhabitable. So, ex-NASA pilot ‘Cooper’ (Matthew McConaughey) is summoned back to space \\ntravel in a bid to ﬁnd a new planet for the species to inhabit. Luckily for Cooper and his team, a \\nblack hole orbiting Saturn can transport them further into space to land on these potential \\nplanets. \\nThroughout the ﬂick, the crew explore multiple worlds - again feeding Nolan’s mind more \\nopportunities to create crazy scenarios. For example, one planet that Cooper and his friends, \\n‘Brand,’ (Anne Hathaway) and ‘Romilly,’ (David Gyasi) visit initially seems like an inﬁnite sea of two \\nfeet deep water. Not threatening at all right? Well think again, because the crew suddenly ﬁnd out \\nthat a giant 100ft tidal wave is about to hit them, and they have minutes to ﬂy away. Nolan further \\nincreases the stakes in this scene as it is explained that every hour spent on this planet counts for \\nseven years on earth, meaning the planet will be destroyed before they return if their ship sinks. \\nAt the climax of the ﬁlm, the crew end up sending themselves through a black hole into a \\ntesseract (a 3D representation of a larger dimension) to ﬁnd the ‘secret to harnessing gravity’ \\nwhich will let the human race bend space-time in order to survive oﬀ earth. I know. Mental. \\nThe imagination that Nolan possesses and implicates into ‘Interstellar’ is farfetched and \\nwonderful, not only impressing his audience with the appealing visuals he creates, but induces \\nthem to think and discuss what is going on due its scientiﬁc depth. Personally, as someone who is \\nbamboozled by the idea of how big the universe is, I ﬁnd it unendingly entertaining to repeatedly \\nwatch this ﬁlm and understanding it more each time, and can only hope the technology portrayed \\nwill one day come true. \\nOverall, ‘Interstellar’ is a clear example of Nolan’s auteur talent, as he once again ﬁgments yet \\nanother cluster of conditions for us to marvel at. With a fantastic score from world famous \\ncomposer Hanz Zimmer, his epic, orchestral theme sets the audience in the palm of his hands as \\nwe stress over how we are all going to be saved once again.\\n\"\"\"\\n\\n',\n",

Texts can contain mixed feelings (e.g., \"bittersweet\") or use similar language to express different emotions, causing their embeddings to be naturally close in semantic space. And also the process of projecting high-dimensional embeddings down to a 2D visualization inevitably loses some information, which can make distinct clusters appear to overlap."

    "Dimensional Reduction: 3D preserves more structure from the original high-dimensional embedding space because it retains an extra axis while the 2D\n",
    "plot compresses all variability into two axes, which can cause overlapping clusters that are actually separable in higher dimensions\n",
    "Cluster Separation: In 3D, some some emotion clusters that looked merged in 2D may appear more distinct because they have separation along the third axis,\n",
    "while in 2D subtle variations in intensity or subclusters often become less visible\n",

    "RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a technique where a language model combines document retrieval with text generation. In RAG, a retrieval system first finds relevant documents or text chunks, and then the language model uses this retrieved information to generate a more informed and accurate response. This method enhances the model's ability to answer questions by grounding its responses in real, external data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following code, we will load a webpage as a document, which allows us to retrieve text from a URL. After loading the content, we will split the document into smaller, manageable chunks, making it easier for our model to process. Then, we'll generate embeddings for these chunks with a specified LLM model (Gemini Embedding Model). These embeddings will be stored in a vector database, which enables us to perform similarity searches. By setting up this retrieval system, we can use a RAG chain to answer questions. The retriever finds relevant text chunks from the document based on a query, and the LLM generates a response by incorporating this retrieved information, making the answers more grounded and accurate.\n",

    "- **Advanced topic - QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adapter):** QLoRA is a method used to make fine-tuning large language models more efficient. It works by adding a small, trainable part (LoRA) to a pre-trained model, while keeping the rest of the model frozen. At the same time, it reduces the size of the model’s data using a process called quantization, which makes the model require less memory. This allows you to fine-tune large models without needing as much computational power, making it easier to adapt models for specific tasks.
