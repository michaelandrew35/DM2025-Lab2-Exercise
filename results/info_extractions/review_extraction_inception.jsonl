review: Inception\nMarcelo Rinesi\nmarcelo.rinesi@gmail.com\nJournal of Evolution and Technology - Vol. 21 Issue 1 – July 2010 - pgs 60-61\nhttp://jetpress.org/v21/rinesi.htm\nThe protagonist of Inception (dir. Christopher Nolan, 2010), Cobb, leads a team of thieves with the \nunlikely speciality of entering people’s dreams and extracting information from them. Cobb is not a \ncriminal by choice; he faces a murder charge that makes it impossible for him to apply his skills of dream \narchitecture and exploration in a legal way, as well as barring him from entering the United States and \nseeing his two children again. As is usual in all big heist movies (a genre that supplies Inception with its \nsurface structure), he’s made an offer he can’t refuse: in exchange for performing the seemingly \nimpossible feat of inception — planting an idea in someone’s mind instead of stealing information from it \n— his powerful prospective employer will make the charges against him disappear and ensure his \nentrance into the United States.\nOf course, the job will turn out to be more dangerous than expected, and Cobb’s personal baggage, which \nis very much related to the murder he has been charged with, complicates matters further. During the \nmovie we discover that Cobb and his wife spent fifty years in a dream-within-a-dream-within-a-dream-\nwithin-a-dream he refers to as “Limbo”  (subjective time passes exponentially faster the further you go \ndown the rabbit hole). During that time his wife forgot or chose to forget the oneiric nature of the reality \nthey were experiencing, and the only way Cobb found of convincing her to return was to plant into the \ndeeper recesses of her mind the idea that the reality she saw was a dream, and only by killing themselves \ninside the dream they could go back to reality. This was, indeed, an inception... and it ended \ncatastrophically for them, as the idea was still influencing Mal after they woke up, prompting her to kill \nherself while framing her husband for her death. Not only was Cobb forced to flee the United States \nleaving his children behind, but the relentless persecution inside his dreams by a vindictive “Mal” (a \nprojection of his subconscious guilt) made dreams a dangerous place for him.\nThe movie glosses over any technical difficulty in accessing other people’s dreams. The main difficulty \nlies in keeping the target unaware that they are in a dream, while always knowing yourself whether you \nare in a dream or not. Like professionally paranoid career con men, Cobb and his team are always \nsuspicious of the reality they find themselves in. The key to both recognizing and escaping dreams is \nphysicality, in the form of material objects with specific signatures of weight and balance that other \ndream architects would find impossible to replicate, and in the wake response of in-dream physical impact \nor drowning. Matter and force, the physical world, is the only lifeline they have to get back to reality\n\"\"\"\n\n**Page 2**\n\"\"\"\n61\n(labyrinths are often mentioned in the movie, and it’s no coincidence, in one way or another, than the \nlatest addition to Cobb’s team is a young architect called Ariadne).\nBut there’s a subtler, more familiar form of dream the protagonist of Inception finds himself trapped in. \nAlthough aware that the “Mal” that appears in his and other people’s dreams is ultimately a projection of \nhis subconscious, he refers to her and interacts with her as if she were his wife. Although seldom in such a \nliteral way, most of us do carry inside ourselves ghosts of people we have lost, some of them not at all \nhappy with us, and the climactic moment of the movie happens when Cobb is finally able to see that the \nwoman inside his dreams is not his wife, and, if not let go of the guilt, at least let go of his fabrication of \nher ghost. Inception offers no certainty in ontological terms; despite its obvious similarity with The\nMatrix, there is no absolute ground level of reality accessible to either the protagonists or the viewers, and \neven the existence of such a reality is left undecided. However, in the emotional counterpart to this \nargument, the movie takes a definite stand on the difference between Mal and Cobb’s dream and \nnightmare of her. In a way reminiscent of other movies like AI, the “reality of the real” is put in doubt, but \nnot the reality of love and the loved one. Perhaps to question both at the same time would be too \nunsettling.\nTime itself deserves a separate mention. Although the exponential speedup of subjective time while in the \nshared dream state is used very effectively as a narrative device and to underscore the psychological \ndanger of Limbo (where minutes of “real time” are experienced as decades of isolation), none of the \npotential implications and uses of this extraordinary fact is explored any further. This is understandable, \ngiven the potential complexity of the issues raised, but nonetheless frustrating. Time is a key element of \nboth our perception of reality and our experience of ourselves, and the way in which the movie moves \nbetween different realms of subjective time is at least as powerful a premise as the (certainly much more \nvisually appealing) ways in which movie characters manipulate the perceived architecture inside dreams.\nUltimately, the movie itself is a dream, a shared unreality that it’s not so much a logical exploration of its \npremises as a visible manifestation of our ontological anxieties. As humans, and even more so as \ntechnology-using humans, we show a remarkable capability to immerse ourselves in increasingly \nsophisticated symbolic worlds, from books to online games to stock markets. At times, if not most of the \ntime, these worlds feel the only real ones. There’s no need to postulate Matrix- or Inception-like \ntechnologies to observe that these worlds are becoming richer and more complex, and that we are \nspending more and more of our lives in them. This is not necessarily a new or negative development \n(reading still being one of the most effective technologies of both Virtual Reality and inception), but it’s \nnot surprising to find ourselves worrying at times about the depth and nature of our dreams.\n\"\"\"\n\n", "document_id": "doc_18af4fc6"}
