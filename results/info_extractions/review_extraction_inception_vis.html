The protagonist of Inception (dir. Christopher Nolan, 2010), Cobb, leads a team of thieves with the 
<span class="lx-highlight lx-current-highlight" data-idx="0" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">unlikely speciality</span> of entering people’s dreams and extracting information from them. Cobb is <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="1" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">not a 
criminal by choice</span>; he faces a murder charge that makes it impossible for him to apply his skills of dream 
architecture and exploration in a legal way, as well as barring him from entering the United States and 
seeing his two children again. As is usual in all big heist movies (a genre that supplies Inception with its 
surface structure), he’s made an offer he can’t refuse: in exchange for performing the <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="2" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">seemingly 
impossible feat</span> of inception — planting an idea in someone’s mind instead of stealing information from it 
— his <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="3" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">powerful prospective employer</span> will make the charges against him disappear and ensure his 
entrance into the United States.
Of course, the job will turn out to be <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="4" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">more dangerous than expected</span>, and Cobb’s personal baggage, which 
is very much related to the murder he has been charged with, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="5" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">complicates matters further</span>. During the 
movie we discover that Cobb and his wife spent fifty years in a dream-within-a-dream-within-a-dream-
within-a-dream he refers to as “Limbo”  (subjective time passes exponentially faster the further you go 
down the rabbit hole). During that time his wife forgot or chose to forget the oneiric nature of the reality 
they were experiencing, and the only way Cobb found of convincing her to return was to plant into the 
deeper recesses of her mind the idea that the reality she saw was a dream, and only by killing themselves 
inside the dream they could go back to reality. This was, indeed, an inception... and it <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="6" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">ended 
catastrophically for them</span>, as <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="7" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">the idea was still influencing Mal after they woke up, prompting her to kill 
herself while framing her husband for her death</span>. Not only <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="8" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">was Cobb forced to flee the United States 
leaving his children behind</span>, but <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="9" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">the relentless persecution inside his dreams by a vindictive “Mal” (a 
projection of his subconscious guilt) made dreams a dangerous place for him</span>.
<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="10" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">The movie glosses over any technical difficulty in accessing other people’s dreams</span>. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="11" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">The main difficulty 
lies in keeping the target unaware that they are in a dream, while always knowing yourself whether you 
are in a dream or not</span>. Like professionally paranoid career con men, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="12" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Cobb and his team are always 
suspicious of the reality they find themselves in</span>. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="13" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">The key to both recognizing and escaping dreams is 
physicality</span>, in the form of <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="14" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">material objects with specific signatures of weight and balance that other 
dream architects would find impossible to replicate</span>, and in the wake response of in-dream physical impact 
or drowning. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="15" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Matter and force, the physical world, is the only lifeline they have to get back to reality</span>

(labyrinths are often mentioned in the movie, and it’s no coincidence, in one way or another, than the 
latest addition to Cobb’s team is a young architect called Ariadne).
But <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="16" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">there’s a subtler, more familiar form of dream the protagonist of Inception finds himself trapped in</span>. 
<span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="17" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Although aware that the “Mal” that appears in his and other people’s dreams is ultimately a projection of 
his subconscious, he refers to her and interacts with her as if she were his wife</span>. Although seldom in such a 
literal way, most of us do carry inside ourselves ghosts of people we have lost, some of them not at all 
happy with us, and <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="18" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">the climactic moment of the movie happens when Cobb is finally able to see that the 
woman inside his dreams is not his wife, and, if not let go of the guilt, at least let go of his fabrication of 
her ghost</span>. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="19" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">Inception offers no certainty in ontological terms</span>; despite its obvious similarity with The
Matrix, there is no absolute ground level of reality accessible to either the protagonists or the viewers, and 
even the existence of such a reality is left undecided. However, in the emotional counterpart to this 
argument, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="20" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">the movie takes a definite stand on the difference between Mal and Cobb’s dream and 
nightmare of her</span>. In a way reminiscent of other movies like AI, the “reality of the real” is put in doubt, but 
not the reality of love and the loved one. <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="21" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">Perhaps to question both at the same time would be too 
unsettling</span>.
Time itself deserves a separate mention. Although <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="22" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">the exponential speedup of subjective time while in the 
shared dream state is used very effectively as a narrative device and to underscore the psychological 
danger of Limbo</span> (where minutes of “real time” are experienced as decades of isolation), <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="23" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">none of the 
potential implications and uses of this extraordinary fact is explored any further</span>. This is understandable, 
given the potential complexity of the issues raised, but nonetheless frustrating. Time is a key element of 
both our perception of reality and our experience of ourselves, and <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="24" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">the way in which the movie moves 
between different realms of subjective time is at least as powerful a premise as the (certainly much more 
visually appealing) ways in which movie characters manipulate the perceived architecture inside dreams</span>.
Ultimately, <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="25" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">the movie itself is a dream</span>, a shared unreality that it’s not so much a logical exploration of its 
premises as <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="26" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">a visible manifestation of our ontological anxieties</span>. As humans, and even more so as 
technology-using humans, we show a remarkable capability to immerse ourselves in increasingly 
sophisticated symbolic worlds, from books to online games to stock markets. At times, if not most of the 
time, these worlds feel the only real ones. There’s no need to postulate Matrix- or Inception-like 
technologies to observe that these worlds are becoming richer and more complex, and that we are 
spending more and more of our lives in them. This is <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="27" style="background-color:#C8E6C9;">not necessarily a new or negative development</span> 
(reading still being one of the most effective technologies of both Virtual Reality and inception), but it’s 
not surprising to find ourselves <span class="lx-highlight" data-idx="28" style="background-color:#D2E3FC;">worrying at times about the depth and nature of our dreams</span>.
